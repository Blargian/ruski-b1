# Причастие

Причастие (participles) are a way of replacing который, in sentences. One can say that they simplify complex sentences and avoid having to use который over and over again.

They are kind of complicated because the причастие gets made up of two things - the adjective and the verb. They get their ending from the adjective and their form from the verb.
You can think of it like how a baby inherits features from it's mom and from it's dad. Observe the diagram below to see how there can be a lot of different combinations of properties of the adjective and the verb.

For instance _adjectives_ (the которые, которого, которому part) can have:
- gender
- numeration
- case

and _verbs_ can have:
- вид (совершенный или несовершенный)
- time (past or present)
- be active or passive
